    "Backorders happen when supply outstrips the demand, which is a problem for businesses that may result in lower customer satisfaction or even loss of loyal customers. Multiple factors such as incompetent management, miscommunication, or lack of data to accurately forecast the demand. An accurate prediction of backorders can prevent competitor taking advantages of the situation, or potentially losing loyal customers. \n",
