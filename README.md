### <a name="project-overview"></a>Project Overview

Backorders happen when supply outstrips the demand, which is a problem for businesses that may result in lower customer satisfaction or even loss of loyal customers. Multiple factors such as incompetent management, miscommunication, or lack of data to accurately forecast the demand. An accurate prediction of backorders can prevent competitor taking advantages of the situation, or potentially losing loyal customers. 


### <a name="project-highlights"></a>Project Highlights

This project is an attempt to solve ["Can you predict Product Backorders"](https://www.kaggle.com/tiredgeek/predict-bo-trial) on Kaggle with [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


### <a name="install"></a>Install

The project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is necessary for running the .ipynb files to run the code for the project. 

### <a name="code"></a>Code

All of the code is provided in the Jupyter notebook `Capstone_project_code.ipynb`. Detailed code for model selection and parameter tuning is provided in the Jupyter notebook `model_selection_and_parameter_tuning.ipynb`. 

### <a name="run"></a>Run

In a terminal or command window in Anaconda, navigate to the project directory, move to `/code/` directory, and run the following command ```jupyter notebook Capstone_project_code.ipynb```. This opens the notebook in your browser.


### <a name="data"></a>Data
